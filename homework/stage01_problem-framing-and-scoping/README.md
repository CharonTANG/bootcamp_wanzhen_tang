# Project Title
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)
## Problem Statement
Problem: Do abnormal alphas in the CAPM framework generate positive excess returns for investors?
This project will assess U.S. company betas and alphas using the CAPM model, monitor whether abnormal alphas occur in certain stocks and at specific times, and evaluate the viability of such a strategy.

## Stakeholder & User
Stakeholder: Stock investors User: Individual and institutional investors interested in systematic strategies
The project workflow includes data collection, storage, preprocessing, analysis, and presentation of results.

## Useful Answer & Decision
The project will provide a descriptive analysis of stock returns over the past year under this strategy, helping investors assess whether abnormal alpha signals are actionable.

## Assumptions & Constraints
* Data availability and quality are sufficient
* The results may be sensitive to parameter choices
* Analysis is constrained by computational capacity and time

## Known Unknowns / Risks
* Uncertainty about whether future markets will exhibit similar patterns to the past
* Potential survivorship bias in stock data

Goal → Stage → Deliverable
* Goal: Estimate net returns from an alpha-based strategy in the past year
* Stage: Problem Framing & Scoping
* Deliverable: Scoping paragraph + repo skeleton
